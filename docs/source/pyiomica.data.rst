Included data
=============




PyIOmica is supplied with a set of examples that require data described here.

In addition, Annotation and Enumeration functions such as Enrichment Analyses Functions require various dictionaties and information files to be downloaded from the Internet.
We provide a set of such dictionaries and files to make it possible for user run PyIOmica in the abscence of the Internet connection. However the user can always override these files with updates ones by specifying proper flags to the functions that use the dictionaries.
